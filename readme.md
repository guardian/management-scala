================

This project contains various libraries to ease implemenation of
our operational support guidelines for scala webapps.

See the individual readme files on the sub-projects for more
information.


Note on deployment
==================

The current preferred deployment scheme at the Guardian is to use
the Python based `gu-deploy-libs`. The older `deploy-common` is
to be phased out.

Support for `gu-deploy-libs` based deployment is available in
`sbt-gu-deploy-artifactrep-publish`. Please see the usage notes
there.
